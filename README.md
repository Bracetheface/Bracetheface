## 🎯 **Current Focus**
I'm a final-year student with a demonstrated passion for quantitative finance, prop trading, commodities and global macro markets. I'm actively developing my skills in Python, data analysis, and algorithmic strategy development to pursue a career on the buy-side. 

I'm driven by the challenge of finding signals in noisy data and applying mathematical models to real-world market dynamics.
