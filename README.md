### Hi there, I'm Lei 👋

I'm a final-year student with a demonstrated passion for quantitative finance, prop trading, and global macro markets. I'm actively developing my skills in Python, data analysis, and algorithmic strategy development to pursue a career on the buy-side. 

My practical experience includes building and backtesting models for statistical arbitrage and volatility forecasting. I'm driven by the challenge of finding signals in noisy data and applying mathematical models to real-world market dynamics.

- 📈 I’m currently focused on **Financial Derivatives** and **Data Visualisation**.
- 💻 I build quantitative models using **Python**, **Pandas**, and **Scikit-Learn**.
- 📫 You can reach me on **[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lei-cotter/)**.
- ✨ Fun fact: Gold is forged in the heart of colliding neutron stars.
